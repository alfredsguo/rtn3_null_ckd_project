# 	Single-cell analysis reveals the cellular and molecular landscape of Rtn3-null-induced renal fibrosis.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a pressing global health challenge, often resulting from multifaceted etiologies. While the Reticulon-3 (RTN3) protein is known to influence the progression of several diseases, its specific involvement in CKD has not been thoroughly examined. In this research, we delve into the consequences of Rtn3 protein deficiency in CKD by studying Rtn3-null-induced CKD mice. Our single-cell transcriptome data profiles 47,885 cells from the renal cortex region of healthy and Rtn3-null mice. We observe significant alterations in spatial architectures and molecular profiles for various cell types. Additionally, Rtn3 protein deficiency disrupts cell-cell communications. Collectively, our findings offer a holistic view of Rtn3 protein's intricate role in CKD and emphasize its potential therapeutic significance.
